                Prayaas is a non-profit organization run by the students of IIIT Allahabad,connecting hundreds of people with a single aim-to lighten up the future of some frisky little kids. Prayaas is not just a
                teaching program from 5pm-6pm, it has much more to it. It is a continuous effort to illuminate the dark areas near Jhalwa,Prayagraj, some of which have never experienced the light of education before. Prayaas is just a small push in the right direction at the right time. And as you would expect, 
                    sometimes even a small push can do wonders!!!</p></div>

Prayaas helped the family by providing monetary support and blood units, owing to which the girl was able to recover and got discharged.
