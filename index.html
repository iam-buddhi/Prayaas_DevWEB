                    Prayaas is a non-profit organization run by the students of IIIT Allahabad, connecting hundreds of people with a single aim 
                    - to lighten up the future of some frisky little kids. Prayaas is not just a teaching program from 5 pm to 6 pm; 
                    it has much more to it. It is a continuous effort to illuminate the dark areas near Jhalwa, Prayagraj, 
                    some of which have never experienced the light of education before. Prayaas is 
                    just a small push in the right direction at the right time. And as you would expect, 
                    sometimes even a small push can do wonders!!!

Prayaas helped the family by providing monetary support and blood units, owing to which the girl was able to recover and got discharged.
